## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/), specializing in Access Control and Usable Cybersecurity. My research focuses on designing and implementing secure systems that are not only robust against cyber threats but also applicable and accessible to a broad range of users. I am privileged to work under the guidance of [Dr. Gail-Joon Ahn](https://faculty.engineering.asu.edu/gahn/), with the brighest peers at the [Laboratory of Security Engineering for Future Computing (SEFCOM)](https://sefcom.asu.edu/) at Arizona State University.
